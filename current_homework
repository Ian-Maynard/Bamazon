# Week of 12 HW: Node.js & MySQL
 
 ### Overview
 
 In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
 
 Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Prompt npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.
 
 ### Submission Guide
 
 Make sure you use the normal GitHub. Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include screenshots and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.
 
 If you haven't written a markdown file yet, [click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions.

 * If this activity took you between 8-10 hours, then you've put enough time into this assignment. Feel free to stop here -- unless you want to take on the next challenge.

 ### Challenge #2: Manager View (Next Level)
 
 * Create a new Node application called `bamazonManager.js`. Running this application will:
 
   * List a set of menu options:
 
     * View Products for Sale
     * View Low Inventory
     * Add to Inventory
     * Add New Product
 
   * If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app should list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.
 
   * If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then it should list all items with a inventory count lower than five.
 
   * If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, your app should display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
 
   * If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

 * If you finished Challenge #2 and put in all the hours you were willing to spend on this activity, then rest easy! Otherwise continue to the next and final challenge.

 ### Challenge #3: Supervisor View (Final Level)
 
 1. Create a new MySQL table called `departments`. Your table should include the following columns:
 
    * department_id
 
    * department_name
 
    * over_head_costs (A dummy number you set for each department)
 
    * total_sales
 
 2. Modify the products table so that theres a product_sales column and modify the `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that this value is updated with each individual products total revenue from each sale.
 
 3. Modify your `bamazonCustomer.js` app so that when a customer purchases anything from the store, the program will calculate the total sales from each transaction.
 
    * Add the revenue from each transaction to the `total_sales` column for the related department.
    * Make sure your app still updates the inventory listed in the `products` column.
 
 4. Create another Node app called `bamazonSupervisor.js`. Running this application will list a set of menu options:
 
    * View Product Sales by Department
    * Create New Department
 
 5. When a supervisor selects `View Product Sales by Department`, the app should display a summarized table in their terminal/bash window. Use the table below as a guide.
 
 | department_id | department_name | over_head_costs | product_sales | total_profit |
 | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
 | 01            | Electronics     | 10000           | 20000         | 10000        |
 | 02            | Clothing        | 60000           | 100000        | 40000        |
 
 6. The `total_profit` should be calculated on the fly using the difference between `over_head_costs` and `total_sales`. `total_profit` should not be stored in any database. You should use a custom alias.
 
 7. If you can't get the table to display properly after a few hours, then feel free to go back and just add `total_profit` to the `departments` table.
 
    * Hint: You may need to look into aliases in MySQL.
 
    * **HINT**: There may be an NPM package that can log the table to the console. What's is it? Good question :)
